/**
 * CC3UIViewController extends CC3ViewController to provide functionality specific to iOS.
 *
 * An instance of CC3UIViewController manages a single CCNode (typically a CCLayer) as changes
 * occur to the device orientation (portrait, landscape, etc).
 *
 * The loadView method of this controller will automatically create the correct type and configuration of a
 * view suitable for use with cocos3d. You can customize the creation of this view by setting the viewClass,
 * viewBounds, viewColorFormat, viewDepthFormat, viewShouldUseStencilBuffer, and viewPixelSamples properties
 * prior to accessing the view property of this controller for the first time.
 *
 * If the configuration provided by these properties is not sufficient, you can subclass this class and
 * override the loadView method, or you can create the appropriate view directly, and set it into the
 * view property of this controller.
 *
 * You can use the supportedInterfaceOrientations property of this controller to configure auto-rotation
 * of the view as the device orientation changes. Although the supportedInterfaceOrientations method is
 * defined in iOS6, for consistency, this property can also be used in iOS versions below iOS6.

 *
 * Valid values for this property are:
 * - GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16	(or GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16_OES)
 * - GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24	(or GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24_OES)
 * - GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8	(or GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_OES)

/**
 * Indicates the number of OpenGL ES rendering samples to be used for each pixel in the view.
 *
 * This property is used by the loadView method as it creates the view, when the view property
 * is first accessed and the view property has not already been established.
 *
 * The initial value is one. You can set this property prior to referencing the view property
 * of this controller in order to have the view created with a different number of samples
 * per pixel. Setting this value to a number larger than one will smooth out the lines and 
 * edges of your displayed models.
 *
 * The value set will be clamped to the maximum allowable value for the platform. That maximum
 * value can be retrieved from CC3OpenGL.sharedGL.maxNumberOfPixelSamples, and generally has a
 * value of 4 on all current devices that support multisampling.
 *
 * Retrieving the value of the CC3OpenGL.sharedGL.maxNumberOfPixelSamples property can only be
 * done once the OpenGL ES context has been established, which is generally performed when the
 * view is created. This creates a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation where you might need the
 * maximum pixel samples value before you create the view, but can't retrieve it until the view
 * has been created. This particular value does not vary much from device to device, so the 
 * work-around is to determine the maximum value at development time, and then select a pixel
 * samples value accordingly.
 *
 * Setting the value of this property to zero is the same as setting it to one, and either
 * value will effectively turn multisampling off.
 *
 * To have effect, this property must be set before the view property is first accessed.
 *
 * Once the view property has been established, reading this property returns the pixelSamples
 * property of the view itself. Prior to the view being established, reading this property
 * returns the value to which it has been set. The initial value of this property is one.

 * to immediately open a view of the device camera and overlay the CCNode view on top of

 *
 * Setting this property to NO will cause the controller to close the device camera
 * (if it was open) and display the CCNode without the camera background.

 *     with cleaning up prior to the overlay changing.
 *
 *   - This controller is sent a willChangeIsOverlayingDeviceCamera message.
 *
 *   - The isOverlayingDeviceCamera property of this controller is changed.
 *
 *   - If this property is being set to YES, the CC3AVCameraView instance in the deviceCameraView
 *     property is added to the window behind the view of this controller. If this property is
 *     being set to NO, the CC3AVCameraView instance is removed from the window.
 *
 *   - This controller is sent a didChangeIsOverlayingDeviceCamera message.
 *
 *   - If the CCNode was running, it is sent an onEnter message to cause it to restart,
 *     be ready for actions, and, in the case of CCLayers, re-register for touch events.
 *     CCNode subclasses can also override onEnter to perform other activities associated
 *     with adjusting their world following the overlay changing (such as hiding or showing
